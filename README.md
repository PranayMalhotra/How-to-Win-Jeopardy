# Winning-Jeopardy

## Introduction

This project aims to check how likely a question in the Television game Jeopardy! is a repeat of or similar to questions asked in previous years.

## Problem Statement

A dataset containing over 200,000 previously asked questions is given. The task is to check how likely it is that questions are repeats of previous questions.

## Data

The dataset contains columns giving values for Air Date of the show, Category of the Question, Money Awarded, Question asked, Answer - the correct answer, etc. The data was collected for over 300 telecast episodes.

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).

NOTE: Before begining the project, I had renamed the CSV file to "jeopardy.csv" from "JEOPARDY_CSV.csv", which the file is named when it is downloaded.

## Requirements

The project was done in Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.
